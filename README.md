# Simple Python Typist
- It's a simple Python typist
- Gives you 10 random words from a list that's too long for wrapping
- Checks if the user input is right or wrong
- If the input is right, it calculates the words / minute
- If the input is wrong, it prints a message

Disclaimer: Used only to learn Python, not to set an example to future generations ;)
